This program makes the SPDT toggle switches on the isp4256ZE development CPLD operate as bounceless switches. The code can also be used as a template to create bounceless switches on other hardware development boards with little to no modifications.

The code force resets the switches to the proper 0/1 output using the **.AR** and **.AP** properties in ABEL.
